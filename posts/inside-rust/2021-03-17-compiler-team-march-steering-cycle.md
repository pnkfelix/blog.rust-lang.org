On [Friday, March 12th][mar-12-zulip-archive], the Rust Compiler team had a planning meeting for the March steering cycle.

[mar-12-zulip-archive]: https://zulip-archive.rust-lang.org/238009tcompilermeetings/07070planningmeeting20210312.html

(The cycle here is that every fourth Friday, the Rust compiler team decides how
it is going to use its scheduled steering and design meeting time over the next
three Fridays.)

It wasn't until the end of the meeting that we realized that April 2nd is a holiday for many folks.
But luckily we decided to schedule just two meetings anyway.

On Friday, 19 March 2021, we will be having a [retrospective][] on the memshrink
development sprint that we had over the first week of March.

On Friday, 26 March 2021, we will be having a meeting to [discuss][musl-discussion] the static vs
dynamic linking defaults for our musl libc target.

[musl-discussion]: https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/416

Both meetings will run from 2pm to 3pm GMT, and will take place on the
[T-compiler/meetings zulip stream][zulip].
